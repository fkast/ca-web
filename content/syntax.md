## What is a syntax?
Syntax is the grammar of computer languages, and determines what statements are "correct" or understandable to the operating system. Syntax can involve the placement of whitespace, program flow, the order in which operator keywords and their objects are written, or any other aspect of how symbols and characters are laid out to create a compilable/executable program. A syntax therefore can be described as a set of rules describing the form of a program, as opposed to semantics which would determine its content.
