## What is needed to set up a web server for hosting a website?

A server is a computer program or a machine that waits for requests from other machines or software (clients) and responds to them. [1]



### Self-hosting vs hosted servers

Almost any computer with an active Internet connection can be configured to operate as a web server. This allows a person to host a web site or web application from their home.

<b> Potential Challenges: </b> [2]

1. reliability of Internet delivery
2. security
3. getting a fixed IP address 
4. upload speed is lower than download speed meaning you pages may load very slowly


<b> Other options: </b>

- Host servers (fast, always-on, powerful machines with access to lots of bandwidth). Examples of host servers:

   * Amazon
   * Google
   * GitHub (offer free hosting services under limited conditions)
