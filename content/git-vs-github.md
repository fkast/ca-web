## What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

The distinction between Git and Github can be a bit confusing for new users.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source application for distributed revision control ith an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. [ref 5]  In sort, this means that Git is a tool that to manage the contributions of multiple users working over time within a designated file system. Git allows you to use version control for any electronic media, such as documents. GitHub provides a convenient place to store multiple versions of files, share your repositories with other, and access other user’s repositories.[^1]

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a hosting service for Git repositories. It it's core, it's just a place to store your identical working directories - aka repositories, or repo's for short. In other words, GitHub is a service for projects that use Git.  Github gives you a bunch more features, like a nice website to allow you to compare changes and administrate user accounts. But it's raison d'être is to host your repos, and to make it easier for you to push and pull from your collaborators.[^1]
