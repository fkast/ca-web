What is the difference between Git and GitHub?



 


Git is not to be confused with Github! Git is a revision control system meaning it is a tool that manages your source code history. GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories. They are not the same thing: Git is the tool and GitHub is the service for projects that use Git.



         







GIT

Git is a free and open source version control system designed to handle efficiently small and very large projects.

Concepts from Git: Repositories, branches, remotes, committing, pushing, pulling, merging, rebasing, reverting, and cherry-picking.

GITHUB

So what is GitHub, really? Simply put, it is a web-based repository where you can get a free account for storing Git-controlled software. This does not have to be limited to application development either, as Git allows you to use version control for any electronic media, such as documents. GitHub provides a convenient place to store multiple versions of files, share your repositories with other, and access other userâ€™s repositories.
Concepts from GitHub: Pull requests, issues, wikis, forking someone else's repository, Gists,github.com.
GIT vs GITHUB

You do not need GitHub to use Git.
Git = Local (on you computer).
GitHub = Remote (web).
