## How to create a GitHub account?

First download GitHub desktop (https://desktop.github.com/).

After downloading, open Git shell.

Then tell your Git your name and email address, so your all your commits will be labeled with your information, using the commands git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME" , and then $ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
