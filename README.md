This repository is a student-driven content drafting space for ITS help articles.




Starting in 2016, SRC CAs will be asked to collaborate to develop a basic web application called 'ca-help'.

This web application will host a variety of help content.  Content can be comprised of written text, images, video, or any other form of media that CAs wish to contribute.

CA are expected to actively work on the 'ca-help' web application during their time on shifts.  CAs wishing to work during library shifts help to define and achieve goals with respect to site creation, development and content management.

CAs must elect to work primarily in one of two teams:


## Development Team

The development team will take responsibility for building and modifying the web application framework.  This include extending and customizing the core application framework to meet ITS specifications.

The development team will work with the [Django web framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

Each CA wishing to contribute to the development team must be willing to build and work with a testing / development environment.  ITS will maintain an Ubuntu Linux 14.04 virtual machine that can be locally deployed and managed on CA computers.  Where CAs do not have access to a personal computer, there will be an option to utilize a computer at ITS for development and testing.
